Collection of scripts and miscellaneous settings I've learnt from all over the place used to optimise GPU mining performance
-Mainly learnt from Reddit comments and parts of various YouTube videos

-start_eth.ps1 - to replace start_eth.sh for teamredminer to enhance stability when running multiple miners
-RX580_settings.txt - noting down steps to get GUARANTEED ~30 mh/s (+-2 mh/s) for non-abused cards, works for Samsung / Hynix / Micron / Elpida memory types
-RTX3080_MSI_settings.txt - noting down steps to get 100+ mh/s on MSI's Gaming X Trio / Gaming Z Trio non-LHR cards, efficiency is not optimal due to hardware limitations
-VEGA56_settings.txt - noting down steps to get ~50 mh/s on the vega 56
